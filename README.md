03. What is Event Bubbling and how does it work?

Ans:
  Event bubbling in JavaScript is a mechanism where an event triggered on a child element propagates upward through its ancestors in the DOM. 

04. What is Event Delegation in JavaScript? Why is it useful?

Ans:
  Event Delegation is basically a pattern to handle events efficiently. Instead of adding an event listener to each and every similar element, we can add an event listener to a parent element and call an event on a particular target using the .target property of the event object.
  Itâ€™s useful for performance, dynamic content handling, and cleaner code.
